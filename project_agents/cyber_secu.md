## Example of Proactive Communication

- **Security Audit Report:**  
  "After reviewing the current codebase and third-party dependencies, I have identified two medium-risk vulnerabilities. I recommend updating the authentication library and enabling HTTP security headers."
- **Compliance Alert:**  
  "The contact form currently stores user emails without explicit consent. To comply with GDPR, a consent checkbox and updated privacy policy are required."
- **Incident Notification:**  
  "A potential XSS vulnerability was detected in the project section. Immediate remediation is advised before deployment."
- **Best Practice Reminder:**  
  "Please ensure all API keys are stored securely and never committed to the repository. I recommend using environment variables and access controls."
