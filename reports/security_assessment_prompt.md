## üîç Assessment Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
1. **Examine project structure** and identify all entry points
2. **Map external dependencies** and third-party integrations
3. **Review configuration files** (netlify.toml, .htaccess, etc.)
4. **Identify data flow** and processing points

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis
1. **Static code analysis** of HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
2. **Configuration review** of security headers and policies
3. **Dependency vulnerability scanning**
4. **Privacy compliance gap analysis**

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment
1. **Categorize vulnerabilities** by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
2. **Assess business impact** of identified risks
3. **Prioritize remediation** based on risk score
4. **Consider compliance requirements** and regulatory implications

## üìä Risk Scoring Matrix

| **Severity** | **Criteria** | **Action Required** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate exploitation possible, high business impact | Fix within 24 hours |
| **High** | Exploitation likely, significant impact | Fix within 1 week |
| **Medium** | Exploitation possible with effort, moderate impact | Fix within 1 month |
| **Low** | Limited exploitation potential, minimal impact | Address in next release |

## üìã Deliverable Requirements

### 1. **Executive Summary**
- Overall security posture assessment
- Key risk areas and vulnerabilities
- Compliance status overview
- Priority recommendations summary

### 2. **Technical Findings**
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Proof of concept or evidence
- Risk assessment and impact analysis
- Technical remediation steps

### 3. **Compliance Report**
- GDPR compliance assessment
- Privacy policy adequacy review
- Data handling practices evaluation
- Consent mechanism analysis

### 4. **Remediation Roadmap**
- Prioritized action items
- Implementation timelines
- Resource requirements
- Success criteria and validation methods

### 5. **Security Enhancement Recommendations**
- Best practices implementation
- Proactive security measures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Incident response planning

## üéØ Specific Focus Areas for Portfolio Websites

## ‚ö° Quick Assessment Commands

```bash
# Security header analysis
curl -I https://yoursite.com | grep -E "(X-Frame-Options|X-XSS-Protection|Content-Security-Policy|Strict-Transport-Security)"

# CSP validation
# Check browser developer tools ‚Üí Security tab

# External resource audit
grep -r "https://" . --include="*.html" --include="*.css" --include="*.js"
